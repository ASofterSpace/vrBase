# VR Base

**Class:** A Softer Space Internal

**Language:** C#

**Platform:** Unity for VR Goggles (Oculus and Vive)

This is our VR Base in which we experiment with new technologies, play around with ideas and in which anything and everything might happen :)

## Setup and Run

To actually set up and run this project you also need the complete Unity files, resources etc.
However, they don't play nicely with git, so currently we here only check in our project source code.

If you do need the full Unity files, just write to us! :)

## License

We at A Softer Space really love the Unlicense, which pretty much allows anyone to do anything with this source code.
For more info, see the file UNLICENSE.

If you desperately need to use this source code under a different license, [contact us](mailto:info@asofterspace.com) - I am sure we can figure something out.
